# Experiment results of "Exploring the use of Language Models to Enhance Datasets Explainability via Documentation"

## What is it in this repository?

This repository is anonmyzed to comply to the annonymization process of CKIM conference.

In this repository you will find the results and the code to reproduce the experiments done in the submission titled: "Exploring the use of Language Models to Enhance Datasets Explainability via Documentation"

The results of the experiment can be found in the folder results, in the file ExperimentResults.xlsx. Inside the file you will find instruction and guides to understand the results.

To reproduce the results you can execute the notebokke "dataset_extraction.ipynb".

To execute this file, you will need to have java and python 3 installed in your system. 

Inside the notebook you will have to point to one of the dataset files (in .txt) present in the /souces folder.

For instance: 
```documentPath = "sources/Nature-Scientific-Data/A whole-body FDG.txt" ```

And to set up a output file name.

Once all the cells of the notebook are executed, a output file with the results will be stored and the root of the project. 

To reproduce the procediments done by the authors during the evaluation, we can paste the results to the file /results/Sample-results-sheet.xlsx in the sheet "Results-raw". Then, the results can bee seen formated as the provided results in the sheet of the same file "Results-formatted".
